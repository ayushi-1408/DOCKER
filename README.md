# DOCKER
This is a project done by me under IIEC RISE training by Vimal Daga Sir. I have used wordpress:5.1.1-php7.3-apache and mysql:5.7 images.
I have first inatalled docker and then I pull images of wordpress and mysql . I then installed docker-compose and made docker-compose.yml where I worked on yaml language. After that I used docker-compose up command  to start our wordpress services. We can use docker-compose stop command to stop the services. In this way I wrote my first blog by making account on wordpress.
